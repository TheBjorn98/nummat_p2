input and output scaling:

let L: R -> [0, 1] be a bijective linear transformation

let input be y
let y_ann be L(y)

let c = exact or experimental data = F(y)
let c_compare = L(c)

run ann with y_ann as input

let c_ann = result of ann = ~F(y_ann)

c_ann approximates c_compare

since c_compare = L(c) and L is bijective, there exists L^-1 s.t. c = L^-1(c_compare)

let c_approx be the unscaled result of the ann

then c_approx = L^-1(c_ann)
